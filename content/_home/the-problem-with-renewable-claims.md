Over the last decade it has become increasingly common for electricity suppliers to compete for environmentally-conscious customers by marketing their electricity as "100% renewable" and about a third of British homes are now on these renewable offers.

But what does "100% Renewable" mean?

What it strongly _implies_ is that all electricity consumed is that electricity is _exclusively_ renewable and that, at all times, all consumption is directly delivered from a wind farm, solar farm, or some other renewable source like hydroelectric or renewable biomass. This is a simple and compelling image and one that the vast majority of people, who spend very little time thinking about it, will accept at face-value.

But can it be true that a third of British homes are really getting renewable electricity all the time?

Isn't decarbonisation a huge challenge? Isn't renewable generation inherently intermittent? What about on a cold and still night when there's no solar or wind energy but we're all at home with the lights on?

Does the claim stack up?

## There's only one grid
The first charge that could be leveled against the claim is that there is only one electrical grid, one set of wires.

Electricity generators indiscriminately feed their power into the grid and consumers indiscriminately draw from it. At the physical level there is no need, nor any means, to determine where power came from or where it's going. No one customer is any more connected to a wind- or solar-farm than any other customer.

**Contractual provenance**\
![Supplier balancing](/home/assets/grid-balancing-supplier.png){: w="450" h="300" .right}

However, wires aside, there is a deep and meaningful _contractual_ connection between generators and consumers, and this contractual framework underpins the electrical grid and entire power sector.

The of the electricity supplier, such as Octopus and Ecotricity, is to balance the supply of power from generators with the demand of their customers. For every unit of power they sell to their customers they must buy unit of power from a generator and pay for the distribution of that power over the grid. Suppliers that don't adequately contain the risk of imbalance and the market exposure it creates are at risk of insolvency[^insolvency].

[^insolvency]: It was unhedged imbalance that caused the failure of several GB suppliers after the onset of the 2022 war in the Ukraine.

The continuous contractual balancing of supply and demand underpins the entire power sector and is critical to the physical stability of the grid.

So, although it is indeed that case that there's no physical connection between a specific generator and a specific consumer, there is a very real contractual connection which defines the entire sector.

Customers who make a point of choosing a supplier who has contracted a lot of renewable generation have, in a very real sense, funded the purchase of that specific power.

## Handling intermittency
The bigger challenge to suppliers' claims are that the grid must be balanced at all times but renewables are intermittent.

**Grid balancing**
![Grid Balancing](/home/assets/grid-balancing.png){: w="450" h="300" .right}\
The grid must be in perfect equipoise at all moments, hour by hour, second by second. Whatever is consumed from the grid must be delivered in equal and simultaneous measure by the generators that feed the grid.

A reasonable analogy is a reservoir of water that must always be at a constant height[^voltage-water]: whenever water is withdrawn must be instantaneously replaced by exactly the same volume.

[^voltage-water]: Where the height of the water in the reservoir represents the voltage of the grid

The grid is intricately balanced by a combination of power markets, small automated adjustment of generators, and by the direct intervention by National Grid. Even slight imbalances can lead to equipment failure, brown-outs, and blackouts.

**The intermittency of renewables**\
And yet the sun doesn't always shine and the wind doesn't always blow!

So in order for the grid to remain balanced when there's a scarcity of wind and solar power we depend upon 'firm supply', which currently mostly means gas-powered generators.

![Intermittency of renewables](/home/assets/fractional-grid-mix.png){: w="800" h="533"}
_The fraction of the grid that is gas-powered (in grey) is directly and inversely correlated to the fraction that is from wind (in green)_

## Flexibility
In the long term we need to be able to work around the intermittency of renewable generation by:

1. **Flexing supply** by charging batteries when renewable power is abundant, and discharging them when they are scarce
2. **Flexing demand** by discounting the price of power to incentivise customers to shift consumption to when renewables are abundant (offers like the [agile tariff from Octopus](https://octopus.energy/smart/agile/) already do this)

![Matching supply and demand](/home/assets/solar-matching-flexibility-annotation.png){: w="800" h="400"}

Flexibility is essential for the deep decarbonisation of the grid, but we currently don't have very much of it.

![Flexibility versus consumption](/home/assets/fractional-grid-mix-aggregated.png){: w="450" h="300" .right}
The number of batteries on the grid has grown dramatically over the last five years and numbers are expected to triple in the next couple of years but the total capacity is still tiny when compared to the rest of the grid.

Our ability to flex demand will increase as our homes are electrified but, at the end of the day, power is a cheap commodity and most demand will be fairly inelastic[^flexibility].

[^flexibility]: As homes and economies increasingly electrify and digitise there will be more and more opportunity for automated, unobtrusive demand shifting. However, power is normally very cheap and so most consumption is fairly inelastic. The value of demand flexibility will mostly be during the few hours of the year when the grid is most stretched, such as very cold evenings when the wind isn't blowing.

So, we need energy storage and load flexibility but we don't currently have anywhere near the capacity to meaningful handle the intermittency of renewables[^fuel-mix].

[^fuel-mix]: We also need 'firm' carbon-free generators renewable biomass, hydroelectric, and nuclear.

<!-- Indeed, this is one of the reasons why it is so important that consumers understand what they are getting from the "100% renewable" offers. If power isn't already genuinely decarbonised it needs to be - pronto - with a lot more renewables and flexibility. And suppliers play a crucial role in rendering the preferences and payments of environmentally conscious customers into new grid infrastructure (more on this in future posts). <!-- TODO: add link -->

## Not as it first appears
We've established that suppliers can and should market their power as renewable if they've contracted its generation but that it would be very difficult - impossible even - for a supplier to perfectly match their renewable supply to their consumers' demand. Renewables are intermittent and the grid is currently inflexible!

Renewable offers generally come at just a 5% premium compared to normal, undifferentiated power and yet it would be _inordinately_ expensive for a supplier to guarantee that all consumption is at all times met by renewable generation.

So, "100% renewable" cannot mean _exclusively_ renewable.

## A definitive view
With public data we can assemble a definitive view of what British suppliers are selling their customers.

This methodology has been developed by Matched with contributions from experts in the field: our code [is open-source](https://github.com/matched-energy/scores) and our approach will be described in detail in a future post.

We'll dig into the situation at Octopus since they are one of the largest suppliers that markets their electricity as renewable; the results for other suppliers are shown on the [scoreboard](/scoreboard).

<!-- TODO: labels to charts and make prettier -->
![Octopus imbalance in May](/home/assets/octopus-half-hourly-may-2022.png){: w="800" h="500"}
_The aggregate demand of Octopus customers versus the contracted generation_

The chart shows that demand is lowest in the early morning and highest in the evening; the supply is mostly from wind which is sporadic but there's also a fair amount of solar which has a daily periodicity.

What is immediately clear is that supply and demand aren't matched at all times: on the 7th and 8th supply never meets the demand whereas on the 10th and 11th it always exceeds it.

![Octopus imbalance in October and November](/home/assets/octopus-half-hourly-oct-nov-2022.png){: w="450" h="300" .right}
Later in the year the situation is similar: in October there is a surplus of wind and supply exceeds demand whereas in November there's much less wind supply rarely meets demand.

The pattern repeats throughout the year - there is a temporal mismatch between supply and demand.

<br>
## Volumetric matching
On an hourly basis there is an obvious imbalance between the demand of Octopus customers and the supply of renewables that have been procured on their behalf. But, when aggregated over the hours of the year the total volumes of supply and demand are the same!

And this is what '100% Renewable' means!

It means that over the course of a year the volume of renewable energy a supplier buys is equal to the volume of energy that its customers consume.
Customers aren't being served renewable power at all times but, on average, over the course of a year, their consumption is offset by an equivalent volume of renewable supply.

Power consumed when there's not much wind or solar power will actually be predominantly fossil-fueled but sometime later there'll be an abundance of wind and solar and, when aggregated, supply matches demand.

This accounting practice reflects neither power flow nor the physical challenges of running a low-carbon grid.
Moreover it is at odds with the rest of the supply business which maintains a continuous, temporal balance between supply and demand.

The accounting is very approximate and at odds with the rest of the supply business and the physics of the grid which require instantaneous balance between supply and demand.

## Can we do better?
Volumetric matching is simple and old.
It allowed a simple, hopeful message to be conveyed a large number of consumers who generally don't have much time for their energy supplier, and it was probably better than nothing[^confusion].

[^confusion]: Though volumetric matching has caused a lot of confusion

And, even ten years ago, the practice was much more reasonable: when renewables were still a very small fraction of the grid-mix it really was a challenge for a supplier to just get _volume_.

But these days renewables are increasingly competitive with fossil-fueled generation, volume is abundant, and the new challenge is _timing_.

It is no longer meaningful to treat solar power as though it can be trivially consumed at night, or wind power as though it can be shifted across seasons.

Instead we need new metrics that acknowledge the challenges of matching supply and demand in time, and which remind us how far we really are from having power that is exclusively renewable. And we need to reward the practices and suppliers that do the most to decarbonise power the fastest.

And the urgency is real since we increasingly often have an oversupply of renewables which leads to price cannibalization for, and curtailment of, renewable power[^oversupply].

[^oversupply]: TODO

The accounting practices behind renewable claims need to be updated to respect the challenge of temporally matching renewable supply with consumer demand.

## Instantaneous balancing
![Grid Balancing](/home/assets/grid-balancing.png){: w="550" h="366" .right}
The bigger challenge to suppliers' renewables claim is that of intermittency - the sun doesn't shine and the wind doesn't blow!

And yet the grid must be perfectly balanced at all moments, instantaneously, second-by-second. Whatever consumers demand from the grid must be met in equal and instantaneous measure by generators that feed the grid.

The balancing act is incredible and intricate dance of the power markets, automatic micro-adjustments from generators, and direct interventions by the control room at National Grid. Even slight imbalances can lead to equipment failure, brown-outs, and blackouts.

So, in order for consumption to be powered by a wind-farm it must be simultaneous to the generation and, similarly, in order to be solar-powered consumption needs to be during the day!

## Flexibility
There are two mechanisms by which to handle the intermittency of wind- and solar-power:

Supply-side flexibility:
: Charge/discharge batteries when wind/solar are abundant/scarce

Demand-side flexibility:
: Plans like the [agile tariff from Octopus](https://octopus.energy/smart/agile/) offer discounts - or even free electricity - when renewables are abundant


The number of batteries on the grid has exploded: up nearly 10x over the last five years, with another 3x forecast in the next two years. However, we still don't even have the capacity to shift 1% of daily generation, let alone move energy between weeks or months.

Demand-flexibility is an increasingly valuable lever as we electrify our homes and, to some degree, smart-devices can automatically shift their load based on signals from the grid. However, power remains a cheap commodity and convenience is king, so most consumption will be fairly inelastic and demand-flexibility will have a marginal effect on the grid[^flexibility].

[^flexibility]: Demand-flexibility is most valuable during times of duress, when the grid is most stretched.

We need a lot more flex on the grid to handle a high penetration of renewables (more on this in future posts).

[^fuel-mix]: there are other 'firm' renewables: pumped hydro and renewable biofuel

## '100% Renewable'

So, we've established that:

**1) A supplier can market 'renewable energy' if they procure enough to meet their consumers' demand**
Physically this power is indistinguishable from the power procured by other suppliers, but in terms of the contractual framing that underpins the grid the suppliers' power is clearly designated for their customers.

**2) Generation and consumption must be synchronised**
Since the grid must be instantaneously balanced, and because there is currently very little supply- or demand-side flexibility.

The second condition is problematic! Given the intermittency of wind and solar and the very limited flexibility of the current grid it would be impossible (or at least inordinately expensive [^expensive]) for a supplier to synchronise generation and consumption.

[^expensive]: Whereas green tariffs generally only fetch a 5% margin over 'dirty' tariffs

So the claim of "100% renewables" _cannot_ mean that all power consumed at all times is renewable!
