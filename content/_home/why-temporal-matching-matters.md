## The imperative
Temporal matching is important for four reasons:

#### 1) Grid physics
The electrical grid depends on the continuous balance of supply and demand, moment by moment and day by day.

Until temporally matched, certificate-based accounting [cannot represent power-flow](/a-better-yardstick) and the physical challenges of running a low-carbon grid.

Electricity suppliers need to temporally match their power positions with demand so already have the constitutional capability to temporally match certificates, and some suppliers have already started offering temporally-matched renewable power to commercial customers[^good-energy].

#### 2) Transparent marketing
The power sector is complex and people are busy so it's reasonable that most consumers assume that '100% renewable' means _exclusively_ renewable.

The confusion amongst consumers risks a breakdown in trust and a backlash against all clean-power offers, even those that are high quality, and already there have been some high-profile repudiations[^repudiations].

The power sector is complex and most consumers have very little time or interest for it and, as a result, would be entirely excused for assuming that tariffs branded "100% renewable" do - in actual fact - deliver power to their homes that is exclusively renewable at all times.

[^repudiations]: TODO, Ovo & recent articles, etc

The issue is not with certificates, which remain a good method for tracking renewable power on open and liquid markets, but certificate-based accounting needs to be updated to temporally match supply with demand.

#### 3) Market signal
Renewable tariffs have the potential to incentivise the development of low-carbon infrastructure since the premium that consumers pay for clean power is an additional revenue stream.

A third of British homes are now on renewable tariffs for which they pay roughly a 5% premium and, collectively, generate £500M annually[^market-signal].

[^market-signal]: A not insignificant figure since, by comparison, the recently-increased clean energy subsidy from the new Labor government is [£1.5 billion/year](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/record-breaking-funding-for-clean-energy-in-britain)

But renewables are increasingly cost-competitive on unsubsidised terms and the growing consensus is that renewable tariffs, in their current form, do little to incentivise new grid developments[^energy-tag-additionality]. Without temporal matching the exercise is too cheap and easy, and the market signal is too weak and diffuse.

Increasingly grids are _oversupplied_ with renewables at certain times of the year[^curtailment] so the challenge is ever less to buy buying renewable power but ever more to buy it at the _right time_.

[^curtailment]: TODO curtailment and price-cannibalisation numbers

Temporally-matched renewable tariffs would send a clearer market signal by:
1. Allowing more differentiation between tariffs by raising the bar and enabling the cleanest tariffs to charge higher premiums
2. Incentivising investment in energy storage and the load flexibility that are essential for deeply decarbonised grids

The same studies that demonstrate the non-additionality of tariffs _without_ temporal matching also conclude that tariffs _with_ temporal matching would meaningfully and substantially influence grid investments[^energy-tag-additionality].

[^energy-tag-additionality]: See [this literature review](https://energytag.org/impact-scientific-consensus-on-the-benefits-of-granular-accounting) from EnergyTag

#### 4) Climate emergency
Electricity already accounts for a third of global emissions and under most net-zero scenarios its consumption almost doubles by mid-century.
The imperative to decarbonise electricity is clear but the urgency of the purpose can be lost, or even obscured, in vague and ambiguous claims[^5-pct].

[^5-pct]: If it really were the case that electricity could be fully decarbonised for just a 5% premium then climate change would be much less of an issue!

The metrics by which we judge clean power need to be clear, frank, and physical.

Matched is part of a growing movement that is calling for the widespread adoption of temporal matching in the accounting of renewable offers.

The movement include tech giants[^google-microsoft], independent non-profit groups[^energy-tag], and startups[^granular-energy] and, excitingly, some energy suppliers who are starting to offer temporally-matched power to commercial customers[^good-energy].

The mission of the Matched initiative is to accelerate the widespread adoption of temporally-matched renewable power and our [scoreboard](/scoreboard) uses public data to rank the power from different suppliers in these terms.

Our grids have been transformed over the last decade and even bigger changes are coming so the need for precise accounting and clear metrics is pressing.

====================

## Temporal-matching
Without certificates that are temporally matched, power can not be regarded as exclusively renewable.

And yet the current practice amongst suppliers who offer green tariffs is to buy certificates that match their power on a volumetric and locational basis but **not** on a temporal basis, and it is only within these very lenient terms that they are '100% renewable'.

And without temporality, the matching process is pretty easy since renewable certificates can be bought at any time[^annual-matching] to offset consumption at any other time and, as a result, there is little market competition and the price of certificates is low[^certificate-prices].

And low certificate prices means that green tariffs do little to incentivise the development of new renewable projects.


[^certificate-prices]: In the most recent compliance-cycle prices were [as low as £2.50/MWh](https://montelnews.com/news/7de0555e-2427-4726-9fc9-c7bd7560d10b/uk-rego-prices-slump-80-ahead-of-compliance-deadline)
## Raising the bar
Matched is part of a growing movement that calls for a disambiguation of terms since power that isn't backed by temporally-matched certificates cannot be regarded as exclusively renewable.

<!-- TODO: have a page on the temporal-matching movement -->

The Matched [scoreboard](/scoreboard) rates suppliers ability to temporally match supply and demand and, even amongst those with green tariffs, identifies notable differences between suppliers.
