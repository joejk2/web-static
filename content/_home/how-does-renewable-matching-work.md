Power is a commodity and is traded on markets that don't track the origin or carbon-intensity of power. Generators feed their power onto a high-voltage grid that serves an entire nation and from which end-users consume indiscriminately.

So how then can we track the origination of a suppliers' power and the degree to which it is renewable?


## Renewable certificates
Since power markets treat all power as a fungible commodity a separate mechanism is necessary to track power that is specifically from renewable generators.

The general solution adopted in many regions around the world is to issue a 'certificate' for every unit of energy that is generated from a renewable source and to track these certificates in a centralised, regulated database[^rego-register].
The certificates are called _Renewable Energy Guarantees of Origin_ in Britain, _Guarantees of Origin_ in the EU, and _Renewable Energy Certificates_ in the US.

[^rego-register]: Generally the units are megawatt-hours (MWh) and in the UK certificates are tracked by the [Ofgem Renewables and CHP Register](https://renewablesandchp.ofgem.gov.uk)

![The certificate matching process](/home/assets/certificate-matching.png){: w="450" h="300" .right}
In order to offer renewable power to customers a supplier must buy commoditized power from the power markets and, in a separate market, an equal volume of renewable certificates.

Trading is often done through intermediaries but the result is that consumers, via their supplier and certificates, are buying the 'renewableness' characteristic of power from the generators that produce it.

## Representing power flow
In order for certificate-based accounting to faithfully track the flow of renewable power on the grid they must be:

1. Volumetrically matched
: For offers of power that is '100% renewable' there needs to be a certificate for every unit of energy that is sold to end-consumers: a supplier that serves a terawatt-hour of energy needs a terawatt-hour of renewable certificates.

2. Locationally matched
: Certificates need to be bought from generators that are on the same electrical grid as the consumers: it cannot be consumed otherwise[^offsets].

[^offsets]: Buying generation on a different grid might be a valuable carbon offset but this is distinct goal from the decarbonisation of power.

3. Temporally matched
: Certificates purchased must be from generators that were producing power at the right time: the grid depends on supply and demand being balanced at all times.

## Current practice
The current practice amongst suppliers who offer renewable power is to buy certificates that are volumetrically and locationally, but not temporally, matched with demand[^annual-matching].

[^annual-matching]: Or to require that certificates are volumetrically matched within the same year as consumption.

The importance of temporal matching and the reasons why accounting practices should be updated to include it are discussed [here](a-better-yardstick)[^non-temporal-offsetting].

[^non-temporal-offsetting]: Non-temporal matching is really just another form of offsetting since it allows certificates bought at one time to offset consumption at another.

The Matched initiative is part of a
[growing movement](why-does-temporal-matching-matter)
that calls for temporal-matching to be adopted by the industry in order to increase the transparency of renewable offers and the impact they have on grid investments.
Our [scoreboard](/scoreboard) rates suppliers on their temporal matching and, even amongst those with green tariffs, identifies notable differences between suppliers.

## Conclusion
Certificates are a good mechanism for tracing the generation and consumption of renewable energy and they allow suppliers to offer cleaner power to customers.

However, in order to faithfully represent power flows and to motivate investments in low-carbon infrastructure, certificates need to be temporally matched with the demand they serve.

## Additionality
Green tariffs have the potential to inform and motivate grid investments by channeling the premium that consumers pay for these tariffs, via certificates, to the investors of renewable projects. If high enough, this premium has the potential to justify investments that would otherwise be unprofitable.

However, historically the 'additionality' of green tariffs has been limited by the very low price of renewable certificates[^certificate-prices] and this is, in part, because the current practice omits the need for the temporal-matching of certificates.




Transparency and clarity aside, temporal-matching will improve the impact that green tariffs have








As described [here](/a-better-yardstick), temporal-matching is






supplier who sell power as '100% renewable' is to buy certificates that

in most markets is for certificates to be matched with power on a **volumetric** and **locational** basis, but not on a **temporal** basis.

The current practice amongst energy suppliers of matching certificates on a volumetric and locational basis, but not temporal basis, is really a form of offsetting since it accumulates renewable generation at one time as a credit to offset power consumption at another.



## Additionality
Since customers pay a premium for cleaner power which, via certificates, accumulates to the investors of renewable generators the whole system should help incentivise the development of new renewable projects.

However, the degree to which investment decisions are driven by green tariffs depends on the price of certificates which are generally low[^certificate-prices]. As a result the additionality of green tariffs is generally low[^additionality].

in their own right, the price of certificates will decline further.


However, historically the price of renewable certificates has been very low and so the system has had limited effect (low 'additionality') on grid investments.

The fundamental issues are that:

Greenwashing

And, nominally at least, the sale of certificates helps incentivise the development of new renewable projects by providing an additional source of revenue for them.

The question is though is how much

Efficacy of investment
How much is invested


## The power-based perspective


## Matched take
Selling power as 'renewable' means that it is:
- volumetrically matched
- co-located
- temporally-matched

Though they carry more risk of greenwashing other approaches may also be valuable in certain conditions, but they are best considered as 'offset' schemes. They cannot be claimed to as 'renewable power'.

Additionally, as secondary considerations, the Matched initiative will quantify the degree of power-matching and, further,

sell cleaner energy to customers that wanttors of renewable projects.






## Trading certificates

There's nothing about the system that requires the certificates and power to be coupled so a supplier could get power from one ... but some suppliers prefer to couple.

Theoretically the two approaches should be equivalent but there are some nuances which we will cover in a separate post.

In theory the price of the certificate, and the value to the renewable investor, should be the same in both cases but, in practice, there are some subtle differences that we will cover in a separate post.

Suppliers
Certificates are traded, potentially through intermediaries, but



So far so good, certificates are a good way of distinguishing a unit of renewable energy from a unit of fossil-fueled energy and if a supplier buys enough certificates to match their consumers' demand then they are, in some sense, "100% renewable".

Regulators endorse certificate-based accounting and require them to be part of a suppliers' annual 'fuel-mix disclosure'[^ofgem].

[^ofgem]: For example, in the UK, the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem) says ['Renewable Energy Guarantees of Origin certificates must be held in a supplier’s account](https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/environmental-and-social-schemes/renewables-obligation-ro)
